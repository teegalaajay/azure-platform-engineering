  frozen to commit SHAs; tflint with the pinned azurerm ruleset.
- Architecture Decision Records 0001–0004.
- README with scenario, target architecture and status; security policy.
- `bootstrap/github-repo-settings.sh` and the workstation-setup runbook.
- Remote state backend: `bootstrap/state-backend.sh` (resource group, GZRS storage account with
  shared key disabled, blob versioning and soft delete, `tfstate` container, operator data role),
  ADR-0005 and the state-backend runbook.
- Editor settings that match the whitespace pre-commit hooks.
